    <p>Here's a basic and flavorful dry rub recipe for chicken wings, with added heat that you can control!</p>
    <p>Ingredients: </p>
    <ul>
        <li>2 lbs chicken wings, split at joints, tips discarded</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons brown sugar</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon smoked paprika</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon garlic powder</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon onion powder</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon cayenne pepper (adjust for desired spice level)</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon black pepper</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon dried thyme</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon ground cumin</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Instructions: </p>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat your oven to 400°F (200°C).</li>
        <li>In a bowl, mix together all the dry ingredients: brown sugar, smoked paprika, garlic powder, onion powder, cayenne pepper, black pepper, salt, dried thyme, and ground cumin.</li>
        <li>Pat the chicken wings dry with paper towels. This helps the dry rub adhere better to the wings.</li>
        <li>Place the wings in a large bowl and sprinkle the dry rub over them. Toss the wings until they are evenly coated with the seasoning. Alternatively, you can place the wings and dry rub in a large zip-top bag and shake to coat.</li>
        <li>Arrange the coated wings on a baking sheet lined with parchment paper or a wire rack.</li>
        <li>Bake in the preheated oven for about 40-45 minutes or until the wings are golden brown and crispy. Flip the wings halfway through the cooking time to ensure even cooking.</li>
        <li>Once done, remove the wings from the oven and let them rest for a few minutes before serving.</li>
    </ol>
    These dry-rubbed chicken wings are delicious on their own, but you can certainly add your favorite sauces for extra flavor. Whether it's buffalo, barbecue, or honey mustard, these wings serve as a versatile base. Enjoy!
